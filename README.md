## Project description 
 
PSE_Abilium is an IoT module for the open source ERP system Odoo that enables the management and labeling of meeting rooms with e-Ink displays. The aim of the project is to avoid double bookings by displaying reservation information on an e-Ink display. 

Our custom Odoo module "Abilium Room Booker" is seamlessly integrated into the standard Odoo calendar, extending it with extra functionality to create meeting rooms and link them with raspberrys via MQTT. These rooms can then be booked in the familiar and userfriendly Odoo calendar UI, by selecting them when creating a meeting. Booked rooms are displayed on the raspberry E-ink displays and updated according to their occupation status in real-time!

## Features
